                <p><span>A car</span> (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.
                    Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, 
                    and mainly transport people rather than goods.
                    Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies depend on them. 
                    The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen.
                    Cars became widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T,
                    an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars 
                    were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, 
                    but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.
                    The automotive industry designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and sells the world's motor vehicles, 
                    more than three-quarters of which are cars. In 2018 there were 70 million cars manufactured worldwide, down 2 million from the previous year.
                    The automotive industry in China produces by far the most (24 million in 2018), followed by Japan (8 million), Germany (5 million) 
                    and India (4 million). The largest market is China, followed by the USA.
                    Around the world there are about a billion cars on the road; they burn over a trillion liters of gasoline and diesel fuel yearly, 
                    consuming about 50 EJ (nearly 300 terawatt-hours) of energy. The numbers of cars are increasing rapidly in China and India. 
                    In the opinion of some, urban transport systems based around the car have proved unsustainable, consuming excessive energy, 
                    affecting the health of populations, and delivering a declining level of service despite increasing investment. 
                    Many of these negative impacts fall disproportionately on those social groups who are also least likely to own and drive cars. 
                    The sustainable transport movement focuses on solutions to these problems. 
                    The car industry is also facing increasing competition from the public transport sector, 
                    as some people re-evaluate their private vehicle usage.
                    Traffic collisions are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide. Mary Ward became one of the first documented car 
                    fatalities in 1869 in Parsonstown, Ireland, and Henry Bliss one of the United States' first pedestrian car casualties in
                    1899 in New York City. There are now standard tests for safety in new cars, such as the EuroNCAP and the US NCAP tests, 
                    and insurance-industry-backed tests by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).
